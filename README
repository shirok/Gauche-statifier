Gauche-statifier is a tool to turn Gauche scripts, libraries and DSOs
into a single binary that can be deployed by itself.  Handy in the
situation that you can't install Gauche in the ordinary way on the
target platform.  Written by Rui Ueyama.

It uses some tricks that depends on Gauche internals, and it's unlikely
to work with the most recent Gauche.  I put this here so that those
who are interested can hack more.
